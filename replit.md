# AIQX Labs - Multi-Chain Token Creation Platform

## Overview
AIQX Labs is a professional Web3 token creation platform with a completely redesigned UI/UX inspired by tools.smithii.io. The platform features dedicated chain-specific hubs for Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and Solana, each with their own branded pages and clearly separated tools. Users can easily discover and access token creation, management, and advanced tools for each blockchain through an intuitive tab-based interface. The business vision is to become a leading, secure, and user-friendly platform in the Web3 token creation market.

## User Preferences
- Default theme: Dark mode
- Real-time token status polling every 5 seconds
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, desktop
- Professional blockchain-themed visual design
- Separate pages per blockchain for better UX

## System Architecture
### UI/UX Decisions (October 2025 - Complete Redesign)
The platform underwent a major professional redesign inspired by tools.smithii.io, with a focus on clarity and blockchain separation. Key design principles:
- **Chain-Specific Hubs**: Each blockchain (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Solana) has a dedicated hub with branded gradient header and distinct color scheme
- **Tab-Based Navigation**: Four-tab structure per chain: Overview, Create Token, Manage Tokens, Advanced Tools
- **Home Page Redesign**: Clean blockchain selector grid showing all 6 supported chains with tool count badges
- **Professional Navigation**: Top navigation with "Blockchains" dropdown menu for quick chain switching
- **Glassmorphism & Cards**: Modern card-based layouts with shadows, hover effects, and clear visual hierarchy
- **Chain Branding**: Each chain has unique gradient (Ethereum: blue, BSC: yellow/amber, Polygon: purple, Arbitrum: cyan, Base: blue, Solana: purple-pink)
- **Tool Discovery**: Clear tool grids showing available and coming soon features per blockchain
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- Typography: Inter for primary text, JetBrains Mono for code/addresses. Shadcn UI components with Tailwind CSS.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Wouter for routing. State management is handled by TanStack Query. The backend uses Express.js and Node.js. Web3 integration is managed by ethers.js for EVM chains and @solana/web3.js and @solana/spl-token for Solana. Key features include client-side transaction signing for security (no private keys on server), multi-wallet support for Solana (Phantom, OKX Wallet, Solflare, Backpack), and MetaMask integration for EVM chains. Token creation forms include comprehensive validation and real-time network fee estimations. Token types supported are Standard, Mintable, Burnable, and Taxable (EVM only).

### Feature Specifications
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Dedicated pages for Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base (mainnet + testnet), and Solana (Devnet, Testnet, Mainnet-beta), each with official logos and chain-specific visual indicators.
- **EVM Multisender Tool**: Batch send tokens to multiple addresses across all EVM chains:
  - CSV file import or manual address/amount input (format: address,amount per line)
  - **Real-time validation**: Inline address validation using ethers.isAddress(), amount validation (positive numbers), format checking
  - **Balance checking**: Pre-execution balance verification to prevent insufficient fund errors
  - **Error reporting**: Line-by-line validation errors with clear descriptions
  - Sequential transaction execution with progress tracking
  - Success/failure reporting with transaction signatures
  - Works with any ERC20 token via MetaMask
  - Support for custom token decimals and amounts
- **Token Creation Flow**: Users select a blockchain, connect their wallet, fill out a validated form, and deploy the token via a wallet signature.
- **Token Management (Solana)**: Dedicated page to manage Solana token authorities post-deployment:
  - View all deployed SPL tokens by network (Devnet/Testnet/Mainnet)
  - Real-time authority status checking (Mint Authority, Freeze Authority)
  - Revoke authorities permanently with wallet signature
  - Warning dialogs explaining irreversibility of authority revocation
  - Explorer links for each token
- **Solana Tools (Advanced)**: Comprehensive token management dashboard with 9 advanced features:
  - **Multisender**: Send tokens to multiple addresses in a single transaction
  - **Transfer Authority**: Transfer mint or freeze authority to another wallet
  - **Revoke Authority**: Permanently revoke mint or freeze authority
  - **Mint Tokens**: Mint additional tokens to any wallet (requires mint authority)
  - **Burn Tokens**: Permanently burn tokens from wallet
  - **Freeze/Unfreeze**: Freeze or unfreeze token accounts (requires freeze authority)
  - **Update Metadata**: Update token metadata (Coming Soon)
  - **Change Tax Settings**: Requires Token-2022 with Transfer Fee extension
  - **Withdraw Fees**: Requires Token-2022 with Transfer Fee extension
- **Token Dashboard**: Allows users to view all deployed tokens across chains, with real-time status updates, contract addresses, and links to block explorers.
- **Security Features**: Client-side transaction signing, wallet-based deployment, secure token amount calculations using BigInt, and robust error handling.
- **Network Management**: Includes a manual network switcher with confirmation dialogs, network fee displays, and automatic network validation/switching before deployment.

### System Design Choices
- **Client-Side Deployment**: All transaction signing occurs client-side for maximum security, eliminating the need for private keys on the server.
- **In-Memory Storage**: For MVP, token metadata is stored in-memory, designed for future upgradeability to a persistent database like PostgreSQL.
- **Server-Side Contract Compilation**: Smart contracts are compiled on the server using `solc` to provide ABIs and bytecode to the frontend.
- **Blockchain-Specific Architecture**: A core decision to have independent, dedicated pages for each blockchain, simplifying network selection and user experience.
- **Real-time Polling**: Implemented for continuous updates on token deployment status.

## External Dependencies
- **Frontend Libraries**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Wouter, TanStack Query.
- **Backend Libraries**: Express.js, Node.js.
- **Web3 Libraries**: ethers.js (for EVM chains), @solana/web3.js, @solana/spl-token (for Solana), @metaplex-foundation/js (for Solana metadata).
